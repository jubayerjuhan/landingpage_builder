# Landing Page Builder Project

## Overview
A modern website/landing page builder similar to GoHighLevel and other professional builders, built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.

## Project Goals
Create a no-code drag-and-drop website builder with features like:
- Visual page builder with drag-and-drop interface
- Component library (text, images, buttons, forms, etc.)
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Template library
- Real-time preview
- Export functionality
- Lead generation tools
- SEO optimization features

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + Sass
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Type check
pnpm run typecheck

# Lint code
pnpm run lint

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Preview production build
pnpm run preview
```

## Package Manager
This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Always use pnpm commands.
